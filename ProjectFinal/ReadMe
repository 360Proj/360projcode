Introduction


This program is used to visualize univariate quadratic splines using both touch-based and mouse-based devices.
On transformation of quadratic splines a derivative and second derivative view are updated.


Run Program


1) Run the program by opening the main.html page.

2) Program specifically runs on safari for touch screen and mouse-based computers.

3) Program would run on firefox except the window.event.preventDefault(), to hide the context window on right
click events, is preventing the execution of certain functions. Can remove code and it will work fine,
just right click menu will show up.


How To Use


1) Drag points + control points to change curve.

1) Right click/long touch a point to remove it.

2) Click/touch on curve to add a new point.

*note: It may seem like a bug but if there is not enough distance between points (on the x-axis)
a new point will not be added. This is checked with the addValidate function.

3) Right click/long touch a control point to smooth the function.

4) Right click/long touch a single point to restore it to two points.
